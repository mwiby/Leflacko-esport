I see myself as an above average good Call of Duty player, which is the result after many hours played.
Visit the link here, and you will be able to see stats.

## Teamup

I will try to get some players on the streams I run. Preferably players who are at about the same level
in Warzone as me, do not hesitate to get in touch.
See contact info at the bottom of the page.
